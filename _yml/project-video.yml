project:
  title: Audi A7 Sportback - Run
  client: Audi Japan
  agency: Wieden & Kennedy Tokyo
  year: 2018
  desc: “You guys always do explosions, a lot of complicated simulations, etc. but this time we need something opposite, sorry”. With this “accusation” Mewa – our Executive Producer had to deal with before we even hoped for a cooperation. And yet, as much as it is all true, we still love the simplicity and the art of smooth postproduction. And they trusted us. W+K Tokyo, Taiyo Kikaku and amazing Ian Pons Jewell invited us to work with them for Audi Japan and their Audi A7 Sportback model in Japan that focuses on the concept of feeling free.
